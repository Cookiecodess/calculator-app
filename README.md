A minimal calculator modeled after iOS 17's Calculator app.

The code is a total mess. orz

There's probably some bugs here and there. I think I'll revisit and refactor everything when I have a clearer view of the logic of how a calculator works. I highly suspect the structure should be much simpler than I'm making it out to be.

I should probably have separated the UI logic and the internal calculation + memory storage logic too.
